It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here."

  abstract={High Energy Physics has traditionally been a technology-limited science that has pushed the boundaries of both the detectors collecting the information about the particles and the computing infrastructure processing this information. However, since a few years the increase in computing power comes in the form of increased parallelism at all levels, and High Energy Physics has now to optimise its code to take advantage of the new architectures, including GPUs and hybrid systems. One of the primary targets for optimisation is the particle transport code used to simulate the detector response, as it is largely experiment independent and one of the most demanding applications in terms of CPU resources. The Geant Vector Prototype project aims to explore innovative designs in particle transport aimed at obtaining maximal performance on the new architectures. This paper describes the current status of the project and its future perspectives. In particular we describe how the present design tries to expose the parallelism of the problem at all possible levels, in a design that is aimed at minimising contentions and maximising concurrency, both at the coarse granularity level (threads) and at the micro granularity one (vectorisation, instruction pipelining, multiple instructions per cycle). The future plans and perspectives will also be mentioned.}

 abstract={Existing concurrency platforms for dynamic multithreading do not provide repeatable parallel random-number generators. This paper proposes that a mechanism called pedigrees be built into the runtime system to enable efficient deterministic parallel random-number generation. Experiments with the open-source MIT Cilk runtime system show that the overhead for maintaining pedigrees is negligible. Specifically, on a suite of 10 benchmarks, the relative overhead of Cilk with pedigrees to the original Cilk has a geometric mean of less than 1%. We persuaded Intel to modify its commercial C/C++ compiler, which provides the Cilk Plus concurrency platform, to include pedigrees, and we built a library implementation of a deterministic parallel random-number generator called DotMix that compresses the pedigree and then "RC6-mixes" the result. The statistical quality of DotMix is comparable to that of the popular Mersenne twister, but somewhat slower than a nondeterministic parallel version of this efficient and high-quality serial random-number generator. The cost of calling DotMix depends on the "spawn depth" of the invocation. For a naive Fibonacci calculation with n=40 that calls DotMix in every node of the computation, this "price of determinism" is a factor of 2.65 in running time, but for more realistic applications with less intense use of random numbers -- such as a maximal-independent-set algorithm, a practical samplesort program, and a Monte Carlo discrete-hedging application from QuantLib -- the observed "price" was less than 5%. Moreover, even if overheads were several times greater, applications using DotMix should be amply fast for debugging purposes, which is a major reason for desiring repeatability.}

 abstract="On dynamic multithreaded platforms with on-line scheduling such as work-stealing, randomized computations raise the issue of reproducibility. Compliant with de facto standard sequential Deterministic Random Number Generators (DRNGs) noted R, we propose a parallel DRNG implementation for finite computations that provides deterministic parallel execution. It uses the stateless sub-stream approach, enabling the use of efficient DRNG such as Mersenne Twister or Linear Congruential. We demonstrate that if R provides fast jump ahead in the random sequence, the re-seeding overhead is small, polylog in expectation, independently from the parallel computation's depth. Experiments benchmark the performance of randomized algorithms employing our solution against the stateful DRNG DotMix, tailored to the Cilk Plus dynamic multithreading runtime. The overhead of our implementation ParDRNG<R> compares favorably to the linear overhead of DotMix re-seedings.s.",
